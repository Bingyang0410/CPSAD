## Data Description
The data of CPSAD comes from ceramic packaging substrate samples in actual factory environments. These samples were selected during the punching hole, filling hole, and printing stage, representing actual production conditions and process changes. To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data, we brought these samples into the laboratory environment for systematic data collection.
